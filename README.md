## 🎭 How the AI Magic Works

### Smart Task Analysis
When you add a task like: `"Call doctor tomorrow #health urgent appointment"`

The AI automatically:
1. **Categorizes** as "health" (detected from "doctor" keyword)
2. **Prioritizes** as "critical" (detected from "urgent" keyword) 
3. **Extracts tags** (#health)
4. **Estimates time** (60 minutes based on complexity)
5. **Suggests improvements** ("Consider adding deadline", "Schedule in calendar")

### Categories Detected
- 💼 **Work**: meetings, projects, deadlines, presentations, emails, clients
- 🏠 **Personal**: family, friends, home tasks, hobbies, personal growth
- 🏥 **Health**: doctor visits, workouts, medications, wellness activities
- 📚 **Learning**: studying, courses, tutorials, skill development
- 🛒 **Shopping**: purchases, groceries, orders, market visits
- 🚨 **Urgent**: emergency tasks requiring immediate attention

### Priority Intelligence
- 🔴 **Critical**: urgent, emergency, ASAP, critical
- 🟠 **High**: important, deadline, priority, rush, today
- 🟡 **Medium**: soon, this week, needed, should
- 🔵 **Low**: someday, maybe, eventually, when possible
